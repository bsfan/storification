- Mobile version for Storify Homepage using jQueryMobile.
- 100% front-end only.
- Homepage data is pulled from http://storify.com/storifyfeatured/homepage.json
- Additional story is pulled and rendered inline in the same page.  Due to a bug in jQueryMobile, the back-button won't work without a clunky hack (around line ~197 in storification.js)
- Basic support for different content elements:  text, website, video (YouTube), Tweet, and any other types of content will be rendered using a generic template.

Verdict:  jQueryMobile is still a pretty alpha state.  And the navigation can be improved with back-end support, instead of rely completely using jQueryMobile.
